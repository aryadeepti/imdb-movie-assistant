Content of the files:

## imdb.py
This is the "main" file that will run to see the resulting output to the terminal.

```sh
python imdb.py
python imdb.py --actors "Jennifer Lawrence"
python imdb.py --genres "Fantasy"
python imdb.py --years 2022
python imdb.py --actors "Daniel Radcliffe" "Emma Watson" --genres "Fantasy"
```

## data
In this folder, there is a `imdb_movies.csv` file that contains all the data needed for the tasks. 
Part of the exercise is to read the csv file. Do not change this file.

## tests
This folder contains a set of test files. You will NOT make any changes in these, but rather use them to test
if your code is doing what is expected.
