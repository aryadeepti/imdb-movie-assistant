# imdb-movie-assistant
This is your first project assignment.
You will clone this project and solve the tasks as described in the [assignment documentation on canvas](https://canvas.kth.se/courses/50052/files/8072699?module_item_id=931314). Once completed, you will push your changes back to github.


Content of the files:

## imdb.py
This is the "main" file that you will run to see the resulting output to the terminal.
You have to fill out the content of some functions here.

Some examples to run the file, (see the assignment documentation for examples on expected output).

```sh
python imdb.py
python imdb.py --actors "Jennifer Lawrence"
python imdb.py --genres "Fantasy"
python imdb.py --years 2022
python imdb.py --actors "Daniel Radcliffe" "Emma Watson" --genres "Fantasy"
```

## data
In this folder, there is a `imdb_movies.csv` file that contains all the data needed for the tasks. 
Part of the exercise is to read the csv file. Do not change this file.

## tests
This folder contains a set of test files. You will NOT make any changes in these, but rather use them to test
if your code is doing what is expected.
